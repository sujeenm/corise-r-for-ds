    "\n",
    "Do certain combinations of vowels and consonants tend to appear more often in names? Are there any notable changes in these patterns over the years? In this question, we'll explore the fascinating world of vowel and consonant usage in names across time. This can help us understand how the structure of names has evolved and what factors may have influenced these changes. By diving into these linguistic aspects, you'll gain a greater appreciation for the intricacies and diversity of names in our dataset. Let's dive in and uncover the trends in the usage of vowels and consonants!\n",

Then, you will use this function to categorize the first and last letters in names as either vowels or consonants. After that, you will group the data by sex, year, and letter type (vowel or consonant) to calculate the percentage of births for each combination of first and last letter types."
